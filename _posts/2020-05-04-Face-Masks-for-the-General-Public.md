> Asymptomatic (including presymptomatic) infected individuals are infectious. Without mitigation, the current estimate is that 40%-80% of infections occur from individuals without symptoms.

> Respiratory droplets from infected individuals are a major mode of transmission

> Face masks reduce droplet dispersal. 

> the majority of SARS-CoV2 infected individuals remain asymptomatic ... Even individuals who become symptomatic can have a several-day asymptomatic incubation period. ... transmission of SARS-CoV2 by asymptomatic individuals is a substantial driver of transmission, including through droplets, aerosols and super spreader events

> Evidence continues to accrue that masks, including cloth masks, prevent onward transmission of infection

> New evidence finds that the use of clear plastic face shields can prevent onward transmission of droplets and aerosols

> This evidence supports the conclusion that more widespread risk-based face mask adoption can help to control the Covid-19 epidemic by reducing the shedding of droplets into the environment from asymptomatic individuals.
