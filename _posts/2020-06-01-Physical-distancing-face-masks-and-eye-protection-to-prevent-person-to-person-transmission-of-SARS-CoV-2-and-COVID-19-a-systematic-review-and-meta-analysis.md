> 172 observational studies across 16 countries and six continents, with no randomised controlled trials and 44 relevant comparative studies in health-care and non-health-care settings (n=25 697 patients).

> Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection.

> Transmission of viruses was lower with physical distancing of 1 m or more ... protection was increased as distance was lengthened (change in relative risk [RR] 2·02 per m; pinteraction=0·041; moderate certainty).

> Eye protection also was associated with less infection
