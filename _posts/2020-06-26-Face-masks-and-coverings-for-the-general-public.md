> Cloth face masks and coverings for the general public are effective in improving: i) source protection, i.e., reduced virus transmission from the wearer when they are of optimal material and construction and fitted correctly; and ii) wearer protection, i.e., reduced rate of infection of those who wear them. 

> Optimal cloth face coverings are made from specific material (e.g., high grade cotton), hybrid and multilayer constructions (e.g., silk-cotton) and need to be fitted correctly

The report also found that there are many social factors in mask wearing adherance such as risk perception and consistent public messaging which may be explored in further posts. They note that although no randomised controlled trials (RTCs) exist because of the near impossibility of conducting one there are other "high quality non-RCT evidence" which should not be dismissed.
