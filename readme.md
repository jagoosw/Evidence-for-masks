# Evidence for masks

This is intended as a simple website to list sources of evidence for the effectivness and necestiy of masks. Initially it will be simple links and a couple of sentences explaining what the links are to.

It could be further developed by having a post for each paper and a short overview of their findings. If you would like to contribute please create a post in the rough format of either: 
- A link to a summary of evidence (e.g. The Royal Society report) with a breif summary of what they found (possibly just quote their summary) and tagged "review".
- A paper (e.g. (this paper on transmission)[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5]) with a summary of their findings and tagged "paper".

Other tags could be used such as "source protection" if enough papers are summarised.
